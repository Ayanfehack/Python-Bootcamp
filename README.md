# Python-Bootcamp
Welcome to my 100-day journey of learning and practicing Python!
This repository is a collection of small projects, exercises, and notes that I complete each day.

The goal of this project is to build strong Python fundamentals by coding every day for 100 days.
Each folder or file represents the work done for a particular day.
